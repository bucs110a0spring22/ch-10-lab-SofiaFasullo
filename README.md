## SUMMARY:
My program is a game where the hero fights against enemies. The enemies move around by randomly wiggling and the hero can attack the enemies and make them disappear when the hero collides with them. If the attack is unsuccessful, the hero loses health. If the hero loses all their health the game ends.
#### Unique Feature
 I added a shield feature where the here has a shield that protects them from losing health. When the user presses the spacebar they can activate the shield.
